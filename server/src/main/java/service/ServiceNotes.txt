To do their work, service classes need to make heavy use
of the Model classes and Data Access classes described above.

Each service method receives a Request object,
containing all the information it needs to do its work.


public class UserService {
	public RegisterResult register(RegisterRequest registerRequest) {}
	public LoginResult login(LoginRequest loginRequest) {}
	public void logout(LogoutRequest logoutRequest) {}
}
