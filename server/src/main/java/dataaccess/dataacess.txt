I am going to do one of these four things.

1) Create - objects in the data store
2) Read - objects in the data store
3) Update - objects in the data store
4) Delete - objects in the data store

Oftentimes, the parameters and return values of your DAO methods
will be the model objects described in the previous section

1) UserData
2) GameData
3) AuthData

Register newUser code:
    void insertUser(UserData u) throws DataAccessException
